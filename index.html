            <p>Dear Recruiting Manager,</p>
            <p>
                I am writing to indicate my interest in applying for the 2024 Bloomberg customer support summer
                internship
                position which requires Mandarin speakers in Shanghai. I am currently a third-year student majoring
                intelligent accounting in Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, with experience working in a
                fast-paced work environment, a firm understanding of corporate finance concepts and relevant knowledge
                about
                accounting as well as computer science. I really enjoy the process of solving problems for others
                successfully and I believe my outgoing personality, strong work ethic, and passion for finance coupled
                with
                my intellectual curiosity and technical skills would make me a great fit for this position.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time as an intern at the financing equity department of investment bank in BOC
                International(China) in the 2024 winter vacation, I participated in the update of the prospectus for the
                IPO
                of a certain agricultural chemical giant. Based on the details of related party transactions provided by
                the
                audit, I verified the specific data of more than 100 related party transactions of a certain enterprise,
                thus knowing the changes in related party transaction types, counterparties, amounts, etc. By involved
                in
                writing asset restructuring proposal, I learned about relevant laws and regulations and the
                restructuring
                plan, which helped me to deepen the understanding of capital market. During I was an intern at KPMG in
                the
                summer vacation of 2023, I participated in the audit of financial statements for a hotel listed company.
                By
                completing accounting drafts for certain subjects and checking whether the ending balance of the bank
                reconciliation statement matches the balance in statement of account ,etc. I have gained a deeper
                understanding of the company’s market position, business and business model, industry competition
                pattern
                and core competitiveness through industry analysis and benchmarking research. In addition, I learned how
                to
                effectively communicate with my team and to finish multiple tasks within limited time.
            </p>
            <p>
                With all the skills and experience I have acquired from my past internships and through college
                education, I
                really look forward to providing exceptional customer service to a broad range of clients and mastering
                the
                method of fast and effective management of various client workflows and hardware/software issues. And
                I’m
                deeply attracted by the open, inclusive and collaborative working environment where individuals have
                chances
                to progress faster.
            </p>
